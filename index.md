## Welcome

<div style="text-align: justify">
    This website provides an overview of our research on visually-grounded language in a continual learning setting. The work is jointly led by <a href="http://disi.unitn.it/~bernardi/">Raffaella Bernardi</a> of the Language and Vision group led by at the University of Trento, <a href="https://bplank.github.io/">Barbara Plank</a> of the Natural Language Processing group at the IT University of Copenhagen and <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/">Raquel Fern√°ndez</a> of the Dialogue Modelling group at the University of Amsterdam. The three group leaders have equally contributed to all papers included here.

### Psycholinguistics meets Continual Learning: Measuring Catastrophic Forgetting in Visual Question Answering
Claudio Greco, Barbara Plank, Raquel Fern&aacute;ndez, and Raffaella Bernardi
#### ACL 2019
<blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: justify">
        We study the issue of catastrophic forgetting in the context of neural multimodal approaches to Visual Question Answering (VQA). Motivated by evidence from psycholinguistics, we devise a set of linguistically-informed VQA tasks, which differ by the types of questions involved (Wh-questions and polar questions). We test what impact task difficulty has on continual learning, and whether the order in which a child acquires question types facilitates computational models. Our results show that dramatic forgetting is at play and that task difficulty and order matter. Two well-known current continual learning methods mitigate the problem only to a limiting degree.
